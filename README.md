This is a school project that helps in Dockyard management using MySQL databases and Python
It also uses CSV as a backup to store whatever the result is after all the operations are completed.

## Modules Used:

### mysql-connector-python
It provides a connection to access the MySQL database from Python

### csv
It provides access to creating and editing csv files through Python

## Concepts Used:

### Functions
These are codeblocks which run only when their calling statement is used. This helps shorten codes by reducing the need to repeat the code multiple times.

### Loops
Loops run the same code multiple times unless their conditions are fullfilled.

### Conditional Statements
Conditional Statements are the if-elif statements which run only when only when any of the given statement's conditions are met

###CSV
Functions like writerow are used to write into the CSV file created for backup of the result

##Languages Used:

###Python
For the entire development

###MySQL
For the MySQL statements within the dockcur.execute()
